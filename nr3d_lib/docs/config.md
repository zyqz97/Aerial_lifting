We have developed a configuration tool based on [OmageConf](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/), primarily because of its convenient [interpolation string]((https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/2.3_branch/grammar.html#interpolation-strings)) mechanism, support for [custom resolvers](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/2.3_branch/custom_resolvers.html), config merging tools, [dot-list parsing](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/2.3_branch/usage.html#from-a-dot-list), etc.

Below are some examples of how you can make config files and how you can dynamically change configs while running.
